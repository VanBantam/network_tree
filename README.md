# network_tree
Tree visualization of a network.  Simple proof of concept based off of the bl.ocks http://bl.ocks.org/d3noob/8375092.

Depends on d3.js v3

To run locally on *nix based os with python 3...
1. clone repo
2. cd to project repo
3. `python -m http.server 8000`
4. open browser and navigate to `localhost:8000`

Note this code uses d3 v3.  As of this writing this is 2 versions behind.  This is just a proof of concept.  Using v4 will break the code.
