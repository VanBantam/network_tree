# network_tree
Tree visualization of a network.  Simple proof of concept based off of the bl.ocks http://bl.ocks.org/d3noob/8375092.

Depends on d3.js v4

To run locally on *nix based os with python 3...
1. clone repo
2. cd to project repo
3. `python -m http.server 8000`
4. open browser and navigate to `localhost:8000`


Note the version of d3 in the repo is v4.  The demo code that this POC is based on uses v3.  
So you'll either have to refactor the demo code or just leave it as it is, where it gets d3 from d3js.org.
